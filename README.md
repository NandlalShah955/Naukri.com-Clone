> [Naukri](https://www.naukri.com/) Naukri.com was launched in March 1997. The company was started as a floorless employment exchange. It was a database of resume, jobs, and recruitment consultants. Conceived as a platform of job seekers and hiring managers to meet, the services went commercial in October 1997.

It all started when Sanjeev Bikhchandani quit his corporate job at Hindustan Milkfood Manufacturers (now Glaxo Smithkline) and founded two companies with his partner - Info Edge (for arranging database) and Indmark (pharmaceutical) .[4] Info Edge offered salary reports to various categories of college graduates such as engineering and MBAs. Salary reports were sold to companies, somewhere between 5000 and 10,000 INR.


> Cloned Naukri.com website during the construct week at [Masai School](https://masaischool.com/). Completed the project in six days with a team of five members and implemented the maximum user centric functionality.
